Digital accessibility, commonly abbreviated a11y, is about designing and building websites and web apps that disabled people can interact with in a meaningful and equivalent way.

This course is created for beginner and advanced web developers. You can go through the series from start to finish to get a general understanding of accessibility practices and testing, or you can use it as a reference for specific subjects. If you read an unfamiliar term, refer to our glossary. For those new to web development overall, check out the Learn HTML courses for fundamentals with markup and Learn CSS courses for styling fundamentals.

This is not a complete reference. Each section introduces the section topic, provides context and examples. There will be links to topic references, such as MDN and WCAG specifications, and other web.dev articles. Each section will have a short assessment to help people confirm their understanding.

Some accessibility best practices differ, based on the disability you're addressing. It's important to understand your users and to listen to people with disabilities when they tell you what they need.
