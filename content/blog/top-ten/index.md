Today is my 10th anniversary...of working remotely!

I have some mixed feelings about this, as I've had both good and bad experiences of working from home. So decided to compile some "pro-tips" for people just starting their remote journeys and for us "veterans" to commiserate on.

##1. Get dressed every day

There is a huge temptation to roll out of bed and just wear whatever you slept in the night before. Don't.

By getting dressed in "real" clothes, you are signaling to your mind it is time to begin the work day. Of course, this doesn't mean you have to wear a suit and tie (unless that is your thing) but it does mean putting on something you wouldn't be embarrassed to be seen out in public wearing.

Myself, I often rock a "work mullet" - nice shirt, combed hair, and minimal make-up on top - but sweat pants, silly socks, and slippers on the bottom. It's not for everyone, but seems like a nice balance of the two worlds.

##2. See people (other than your family) IRL

Yes, people can be overrated and annoying sometimes. But when you work remotely, they are essential.

I suggest you find a public spot to work and go there at least once a week. This change of scenery is vital, especially for us extroverts or creatives needing some inspiration or just more environmental energy. Some people are lucky in that they live in cities large enough to have co-working spaces. If so, that is a great option! If not, the local library or a coffee shop should suffice.

Just be careful to not overdo it on the caffeine and blueberry scones....arguably one of the most delicious occupational hazards for a remote worker.

##3. Move it or lose it

Exercise. I'm pretty sure that is doubled-up four-letter word. But for the remote worker IMHO, it is one of the keys to mental and physical health.
